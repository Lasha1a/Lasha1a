👋 Hi, I’m Lasha

I’m a mid-level Full Stack Developer with a strong focus on backend development.

On the backend, I work with C# (.NET 8/9) and ASP.NET, following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and building microservices-based architectures, clean APIs, and scalable systems backed by MS SQL.

On the frontend, I use JavaScript, TypeScript, and Angular to build structured, maintainable user interfaces that integrate smoothly with backend services.

I enjoy learning new technologies, improving code quality, and building real-world projects using modern development practices.
